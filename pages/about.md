## About the Collection Builder CDM Skin
This collection includes photographs documenting Trinity University's history from 1869 to the present. The historic images in the collection range in date throughout the University's first 100 years and are divided into 4 subject categories (based on the University's geographic location): the Tehuacana Images (1869-1902), the Waxahachie Images (1902-1942), the Woodlawn: San Antonio Images (1942-1952), and the Skyline Campus: San Antonio Images (mid 1950s-present).

These collections include glass plate images, tintypes, and gelatin photos, as well as traditional and digital photography. The digitization of this and other collections ensures the continued preservation and improved access to these resources.
